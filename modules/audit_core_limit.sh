# audit_core_limit
#
# When an application encounters a runtime error the operating system has the
# opportunity to dump the applicationâ€™s state, including memory contents, to
# disk. This operation is called a core dump. It is possible for a core dump
# to contain sensitive information, including passwords. Therefore it is
# recommended that core dumps be disabled in high security scenarios.
#
# Refer to Section(s) 2.10 Page(s) 34-35 CIS Apple OS X 10.8 Benchmark v1.0.0
#.
