# audit_aws_cdn
#
# Ensure that all your AWS CloudFront web distributions are integrated with the
# Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) service to protect against application-
# layer attacks that can compromise the security of your web applications or
# place unnecessary load on them.
#
# With AWS Cloudfront â€“ WAF integration enabled you will be able to block any
# malicious requests made to your Cloudfront Content Delivery Network based on
# the criteria defined in the WAF Web Access Control List (ACL) associated with
# the CDN distribution.
#
# Refer to https://www.cloudconformity.com/conformity-rules/CloudFront/cloudfront-integrated-with-waf.html
# 
# Ensure that your AWS Cloudfront distributions have the Logging feature enabled
# in order to track all viewer requests for the content delivered through the
# Content Delivery Network (CDN).
#
# The Cloudfront access logs contain detailed information (requested object
# name, date and time of the access, client IP, access point, error code, etc)
# about each request made for your web content, information that can be
# extremely useful during security audits or as input data for various
# analytics/reporting tools. You can also use this feature in combination with
# AWS Lambda and AWS WAF to process the logging data and block the requests
# coming from those IP addresses that generate too many error codes as the
# requests that generate these errors are often made by attackers trying to
# find vulnerabilities within your website/web application.
