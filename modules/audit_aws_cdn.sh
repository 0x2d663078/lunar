# audit_aws_cdn
#
# Ensure that all your AWS CloudFront web distributions are integrated with the
# Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) service to protect against application-
# layer attacks that can compromise the security of your web applications or
# place unnecessary load on them.
#
# With AWS Cloudfront â€“ WAF integration enabled you will be able to block any
# malicious requests made to your Cloudfront Content Delivery Network based on
# the criteria defined in the WAF Web Access Control List (ACL) associated with
# the CDN distribution.
#
# Refer to https://www.cloudconformity.com/conformity-rules/CloudFront/cloudfront-integrated-with-waf.html
