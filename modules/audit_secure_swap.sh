# Passwords and other sensitive information can be extracted from insecure
# virtual memory, so itâ€™s a good idea to secure virtual memory. If an attacker
# gained control of the Mac, the attacker would be able to extract user names
# and passwords or other kinds of data from the virtual memory swap files.

# Refer to Section(s) 1.4.13.6 Page(s) 47-8 CIS Apple OS X 10.6 Benchmark v1.0.0
